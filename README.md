## Deployment

Run `yarn deploy` to deploy code.
Will also push to `gh-pages` branch, which subsequently updates static site.

Update: `yarn deploy` has stopped working. Instead run `yarn deploy` to generate all the necessary files, build everything etc., then run `yarn deployV2` to actually send the thing to github.
